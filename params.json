{"name":"Nouns","tagline":"","body":"###WYSINWYG\r\n\r\nDo you remember Macromedia Dreamweaver? It was boxed software that you would install on your personal computer, and then you could make a webpage without typing HTML into Notepad. Instead, you'd sketch out your table-based design on a virtual canvas and let Dreamweaver worry about writing the code.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't just Dreamweaver that would do this for you; there were also Microsoft FrontPage, Netscape Composer, and Adobe GoLive. Collectively, they were known as WYSIWYG editors because **W**hat **Y**ou **S**aw **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**ot; the webpage looked the same while you were making it as it did when you viewed it in Netscape Navigator.\r\n\r\nNobody I know uses WYSIWYG editors anymore. There are plenty of reasons not to:\r\n\r\n* Webpages are made of more than HTML now, and the bits that aren't HTML tend to couple in subtle ways with those that are. Dreamweaver will cheerfully disregard subtleties as it overwrites everything.\r\n* We collaborate on web development using tools like git and svn. Unlike us humans, Dreamweaver doesn't care about minimizing merge conflicts or keeping commits clean.\r\n* Dreamweaver makes templating and modularity clunky.\r\n* Dreamweaver *certainly* doesn't care about upholding our coding style.\r\n\r\nAll of the above point to a fallacy at the core of WYSIWYG. What you see does not, in fact, encompass what you get -- not if you care for such invisibles as dynamic behavior and code quality.\r\n\r\n###Designing in code\r\n\r\nDreamweaver is now mostly a memory to web developers, but its suite-mate Photoshop is not. Rather, Photoshop is a de facto standard for designing interface graphics, and what share of that market it does not capture is given to similar tools like Sketch, Opacity, GIMP, and Inkscape. Every popular graphics editor is still WYSIWYG.\r\n\r\nDo graphics editors somehow escape the pitfalls of WYSIWYG? Perhaps, for now. Graphic designers aren't as anal as developers are about version control, and there's not a clear analogue of code quality in the graphics world. But that is apt to change as people who code learn to design, and people who design learn to code.\r\n\r\nConsider the benefits if graphic design were conducted in human-readable code rather than on a canvas:\r\n\r\n* Designs could be meaningfully diffed and merged, and conflicts between divergent versions resolved.\r\n* Designs could be made reusable and self-documenting through decomposition.\r\n* Designs could be literate.\r\n\r\nThese are only the obvious advantages. Since coding is mostly unexplored as a paradigm for graphic design, it's difficult to predict what other advantages could be uncovered.\r\n\r\n###Nouns\r\n\r\nNouns is an experimental non-WYSIWYG graphics editor. It comprises a language for describing graphic designs, and an IDE to facilitate programming. The IDE provides a live preview of the graphics as code is written.\r\n\r\nUnlike Processing, Nouns is a declarative language. It compiles to SVG, which may then be rendered to any number of vector and raster image formats.\r\n\r\nThe Nouns IDE supports syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and adjustment of values and colors using mouse gestures.\r\n\r\nBoth the language and the IDE are under active development, and many additional features are planned in both. The project aims to produce a practical graphics editor that can replace Photoshop et al. for some users.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
